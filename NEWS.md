# dataraft 0.1.0.9000

* Add a guided API reference, motivation vignette, execution-path guide and local pins example. Move component unit tests to their owners and support matching component branches in pull-request CI.

* Start the DataRaft package family with the `dr_` API.
* Separate core definitions and execution from lake, adapters, dbt, catalogs
  and metrics. The `dataraft` package is the shared installation and API entry.
* Keep three guides: getting started, integrations, and guarantees and limits.
* Add a shared condition root and subsystem classes.

The predecessor's development history remains in Git. DataRaft does not promise
compatibility with earlier development APIs or storage formats before 1.0.
