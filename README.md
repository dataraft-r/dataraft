Deliver checked data with reusable specifications, recipes and
workflows. A changed column type or a negative amount blocks a delivery
before its target is written. The result retains the checks and
offending rows for diagnosis.

DataRaft is under development. Before 1.0 the current API is the
supported API.

``` r
library(dataraft)

orders <- dr_product("orders") |>
  dr_add_contract(c(id = "integer", amount = "numeric")) |>
  dr_add_quality(~ amount >= 0)

flow <- dr_workflow() |>
  dr_add_product(orders) |>
  dr_add_recipe(dr_recipe() |> dr_step_mutate(amount = round(amount, 2)))

bad_delivery <- data.frame(id = 1:3, amount = c(25, -75, 50))
checked <- dr_trial(flow, data = bad_delivery)
checked$status
#> [1] "blocked"
dr_quality_rows(checked)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 2
#>      id amount
#>   <int>  <dbl>
#> 1     2    -75
```

Correct the delivery and reuse the same workflow:

``` r
next_delivery <- data.frame(id = 1:3, amount = c(25, 75, 50))
result <- dr_trial(flow, data = next_delivery)
dr_collect(result)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 2
#>      id amount
#>   <int>  <dbl>
#> 1     1     25
#> 2     2     75
#> 3     3     50
```

A **product** defines identity, contract and quality requirements. A
**recipe** defines preparation in step order. A **workflow** binds these
definitions to sources and a target. Definitions do no I/O. `dr_trial()`
checks without writing; `dr_run()` executes the configured target.
`dr_collect()` retrieves the output.

## Packages

| Package             | Responsibility                                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dataraft`          | Metapackage and shared introduction                           |
| `dataraft.core`     | Products, contracts, recipes, workflows and quality           |
| `dataraft.lake`     | Lake storage, releases, coordinated publication and recovery  |
| `dataraft.adapters` | Database, API, Parquet and pins adapters; targets integration |
| `dataraft.dbt`      | dbt execution and artifacts                                   |
| `dataraft.catalog`  | Catalog applications and metadata publication                 |
| `dataraft.metrics`  | Metrics and frozen report evidence                            |

Use `library(dataraft.core)` for in-memory work without the extensions.
Each extension is independently installable with its declared
dependencies. The metapackage re-exports the public family API; its own
R code contains no engine.

Install the development version:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dataraft-r/dataraft")
```

## When to use it

Use DataRaft when repeated deliveries need a reusable preparation
definition, quality gates and an inspectable execution result. Use
pointblank for standalone data validation, targets for pipeline
scheduling, pins for board-based object storage and dbt for SQL model
development. DataRaft adapters connect these tools to a checked delivery
workflow.
